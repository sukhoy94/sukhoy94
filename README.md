# Hi, I'm Andrew

I am a programmer from Lublin, Poland.

I write software both for personal use and for commercial projects.  
I enjoy creating small helper scripts and tools that I use in my daily work.

I started programming when I was 17 years old (now I'm 31).  
In 2014, I graduated from the Lublin University of Technology with a degree in Computer Science and obtained the title of Engineer.

My main areas of interest are backend development, databases and server-side systems.  
I focus on practical solutions, automation and improving everyday workflows.
